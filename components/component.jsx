            2.1 Birth and Early Life: The Artist was born on March 30, 1853, in
            Zundert, Netherlands, and concluded his life tragically on July 29,

            career included phases as an art dealer, a preacher and teacher, and
            finally as a pioneering post-Impressionist painter, renowned for his

            3.1 Initial Employment: The Artist commenced his professional
            journey with Goupil & Cie, which facilitated his stays in London and
            Paris, nurturing his burgeoning interest in art. 3.2 Transition to
            Art: By 1880, the Artist resolved to devote himself to painting, a
            decision substantially supported by his brother, Theo van Gogh. 3.3
            Influential Periods: Post-exposure to Impressionist and
            Neo-Impressionist influences during his Parisian residency from 1886
            to 1888, the Artist’s style underwent significant evolution, marked
            by an expressive brushwork and bold use of colour.

            4.1 Works Produced: The Artist was prolific, creating approximately
            2,100 artworks, which included around 860 oil paintings and numerous
            sketches and drawings. These works are now celebrated globally. 4.2

            House,” “Sunflowers,” “The Bedroom,” and “Starry Night,” each
            epitomizing the Artist’s unique style and emotional intensity. 4.3
            Artistic Style Reaffirmed: Known for his expressive brushwork and
            bold use of colour, the Artist’s style is unmistakable and has been

            5.1 Mental Health: Throughout his lifetime, the Artist experienced
            recurrent bouts of mental illness, which profoundly affected his
            social interactions and productivity. This aspect of his life
            reminds us of the human condition and the struggle often inherent in
            the pursuit of artistic expression. 5.2 Asylum Stay: Reflecting his
            commitment to his art, despite his struggles, the Artist voluntarily
            admitted himself to the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in May 1889,
            where he continued to produce artworks.
